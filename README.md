# Analysis of Fire and Police Department Payroll Data

For this project, I will analyze 10 years of payroll data for the Fire and Police departments in New York City. This dataset represents a well-defined and comprehensive universe of information, making it ideal for thorough exploration and analysis.

It includes a variety of data types such as categorical text with differing levels of granularity, numerical data, dates, and fields with missing or outlier values. These characteristics provide opportunities to practice a range of analytical techniques, from data cleaning to advanced visualizations for pattern discovery.

Letâ€™s uncover the stories hidden in the data!
