# Conclusion

The analysis of payroll data for NYC’s Fire and Police Departments highlights notable differences in employee distribution and compensation patterns. While the Police Department employs three times as many staff as the Fire Department, its total salary expenditure is only 2.5 times higher, suggesting that Fire Department employees, on average, receive higher pay.

Employment and salary trends also vary by location, with Manhattan hosting the majority of Police employees and Brooklyn leading in Fire Department staff. Salary progression aligns closely with years of experience, with employees earning higher compensation as their tenure increases. Among those earning over \$250K, the compensation structure varies significantly, with Overtime and Other pay contributing substantially to total earnings.

Future research should revisit the Police Department’s compensation for 2024, which shows an unusually high surge in total salaries. This anomaly appears inconsistent with the 2024 budget plans provided by the New York City Council and warrants deeper investigation.
