# Introduction

My experience in the financial industry has fostered a strong interest in working with high-volume salary datasets.

For this project, I will analyze **10 years of payroll data for the Fire and Police departments** in New York City. This dataset represents a well-defined and comprehensive universe of information, making it ideal for thorough exploration and analysis.

One of the reasons I selected this dataset is its versatility; it includes a variety of data types such as categorical text with differing levels of granularity, numerical data, dates, and fields with missing or outlier values. These characteristics provide opportunities to practice a range of analytical techniques, from data cleaning to advanced visualizations for pattern discovery.

Specifically, I am interested in studying trends such as workforce growth, salary composition across different roles, and identifying the top-ranking positions and locations with the highest payroll activity. By delving into these questions, I aim to uncover meaningful insights into the structure and evolution of these essential public service departments.

Letâ€™s uncover the stories hidden in the data!
